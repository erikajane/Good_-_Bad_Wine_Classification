# Good or Bad Wine Classification

## Introduction

When looking for a new wine to try, the hope is that you pick a good one. Unfortuantely, you won't know that wine is good or not until you taste it. Luckily if you are able to obtain the physiochemical properties of the wine you intend on buying, you can figure out if the wine is good or not.

What makes a 'high quality' wine, 'high quality'? (What features does a high quality wine include?

Can we predict whether a wine is 'high quality' or not by looking at it's features?

## The Data

From University of California, Irvineâ€™s Machine Learning Repository, two datasets were utilized, __winequality-red__ and __winequality-white__ (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality). The two datasets include physicochemical information  on either red or white wine samples from Northern Portugal. The following twelve physicochemical features for each observed wine sample are as follows:

 - fixed acidity
 - volatile acidity
 - citric acid
 - residual sugar
 - chlorides
 - free sulfur dioxide
 - total sulfur dioxide
 - density
 - pH
 - sulphates
 - alcohol
 - quality
